    "headline": "Strengthening Allied Sector and Market Access",
    "summaryText": "<p>Strengthening Allied Sector and Market Access Transforming India’s Livestock and Fisheries Sector</p><p>India’s agricultural progress is increasingly supported by the expansion of allied sectors such as livestock, dairy, poultry, and fisheries. These sectors have become major contributors to agricultural Gross Value Added (GVA) and rural employment. Over the last decade, agriculture and allied sectors have witnessed a steady 3-5% CAGR, fuelled by extensive government efforts, private innovations, and sizeable domestic demand. It is estimated that by 2047, the sector could potentially triple in size, powering India’s growth.</p><p>Although rural livelihoods remain largely agriculture-based, changes in land use, climate variability, and income uncertainty have encouraged households to adopt additional income sources. For small and marginal farmers, diversification has become an important way to manage seasonal income fluctuations and ensure more stable earnings.</p><p>Diversification includes income from farm, allied, and non-farm activities to reduce risk and smooth household consumption. Rather than moving away from agriculture, it reflects a more integrated and resilient rural economy where farming remains central but is supported by multiple livelihood options. Stronger institutions such as cooperatives, Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) have improved access to credit, technology, and organised markets, helping small producers connect better with value chains.</p><p>Livestock and Fisheries: Drivers of Rural Income Diversification and Growth</p><p>Within allied agricultural activities, livestock and fisheries have demonstrated relatively stable growth rates of approximately 5-6 percent, underscoring their strategic importance in generating rural incomes. Their economic significance lies in generating regular and comparatively predictable cash flows. Dairy production facilitates frequent income realisation through routine milk sales, while fisheries enable multiple production cycles, thereby providing sustained employment opportunities. Furthermore, dairy-based rural households commonly integrate crop cultivation for food and fodder with livestock rearing, enabling circular resource use and reducing dependence on external inputs. Such diversification reduces reliance on a single income source and enhances resilience to seasonal and market shocks.</p><p>Between FY15 and FY24, the sector’s Gross Value Added (GVA) increased by nearly 195 percent, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.77 percent at current prices. In the Union Budget 2026–27, ₹6,153.46 crore has been allocated to the Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying, reflecting a 16 percent increase from ₹5,302.83 crore in FY 2025–26. This expansion underscores the sector’s role in income diversification and livelihood resilience, supported by investments in breed improvement, veterinary infrastructure, and disease control.</p><p>India as a Global Leader in Livestock and Fisheries</p><p>India holds the leading global position in milk production, accounting for nearly 25 percent of global output. Over the decade, the sector has recorded a compound annual growth rate of 5.41 percent, with production increasing from 146.31 million tonnes in 2014–15 to 247.87 million tonnes in 2024–25, representing a growth of over 69.4 percent. This sustained expansion has contributed to improved nutritional access, reflected in per capita milk availability of 485 grams per day in 2024–25, significantly exceeding the global average of 328 grams.</p><p>India ranks second globally in egg production. National output has increased from 78.48 billion eggs in 2014–15 to an estimated 149.11 billion eggs in 2024–25, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.63 percent more than a decade. This sustained expansion has translated into improved access to nutrition, with per capita egg availability rising from 62 eggs per annum in 2014–15 to 106 eggs per annum in 2024–25.</p><p>India is the world’s second-largest fish producer. Output has increased to 19.77 million tonnes in FY 2024-25 from 9.58 million tonnes in FY 2013-14. It contributes nearly 8 percent of global output and supports over 30 million livelihoods, thereby constituting a central pillar of the blue economy. Coastal States and Union Territories, comprising approximately 4,434 fishing villages, account for 72 percent of production and 76 percent of seafood exports. The sector contributes 7.43 percent to agricultural GVA, with policy measures such as reducing GST on key fish products and enhancing domestic demand and export competitiveness.</p><p>India ranks fourth globally in meat production. Output has increased from 6.69 million tonnes in 2014–15 to 10.50 million tonnes in 2024–25, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.61 percent. Taken together, these indicators affirm India’s prominent position as a major contributor within the domestic and global agri-food economy.</p><p>Policy-led Intervention for Livestock Productivity</p><p>The expansion of India’s livestock sector has been driven by focused government interventions through initiatives such as the National Livestock Mission (NLM), the Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM), and the National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP), which emphasise productivity improvement, animal health, breed development, and livestock-based entrepreneurships. Together, these initiatives have strengthened livestock systems, reduced production risks, and reinforced livestock as a resilient and diversified source of income for rural households.</p><p>The National Livestock Mission promotes livestock-based entrepreneurship, improves breed productivity, and boosts production of meat, eggs, milk, and fodder.</p><p>The Rashtriya Gokul Mission focuses on conserving indigenous bovine breeds, enhancing milk productivity, and making dairying more remunerative for rural farmers.</p><p>The National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP) focuses on controlling Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis through 100% vaccination of cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and pigs against FMD, and vaccination of all female bovine calves (4–8 months) against Brucellosis.</p><p>Genetic Improvement through Artificial Insemination with Last Mile Service Delivery</p><p>Genetic improvement interventions under the RGM have reinforced productivity-led growth within the livestock sector mentioned as follows:</p><p>A total of 14.56 crore artificial inseminations have been conducted, covering 9.36 crore animals and benefiting 5.62 crore farmers.</p><p>The training of nearly 39,810 MAITRI artificial insemination technicians has strengthened last-mile service delivery.</p><p>These measures have accelerated genetic gains, improved milk yields, and strengthened the income potential of dairy-based livelihoods.</p><p>Strengthening Animal Health and Risk Mitigation</p><p>Livestock productivity and income stability are closely linked to disease control. Under the NADCP, large-scale vaccination and surveillance efforts have significantly reduced disease incidence. Over 125.75 crore Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccinations were administered, and approximately 26.27 crore farmers benefited. Vaccination coverage expanded in 2025 to include pastoral sheep and goats.</p><p>FMD outbreaks reduced sharply from 132 cases in 2019 to 6 cases in 2025</p><p>Brucellosis outbreaks have been reduced to zero</p><p>The decline in disease outbreaks has mitigated productivity losses.</p><p>Livestock Productivity Enhancement Supporting Livelihood Diversification</p><p>The combined impact of genetic and health interventions is reflected in sustained improvements in bovine productivity. India is home to the world's largest bovine population and has witnessed significant growth in meat and poultry production.</p><p>Indigenous (local) and non-descript (mix-breed) cattle productivity increased from 927 kg per animal per year (2014–15) to 1,292 kg (2023–24), a rise of 39.37 percent.</p><p>Buffalo productivity increased from 1,880 kg to 2,161 kg, registering 14.94 percent growth during the same period.</p><p>Average bovine productivity improved from 1,648.17 kg (2013–14) to 2,079 kg (2024–25), reflecting a 27 percent rise.</p><p>These productivity gains represent one of the highest recorded improvements globally and directly enhance income realisation from dairy-based livelihoods.</p><p>Scaling Milk Procurement and Processing Capacity</p><p>The expansion of dairy cooperatives has played a pivotal role in strengthening market integration by incorporating smallholders into organised procurement and processing systems.</p><p>The dairy network encompasses:</p><p>22 milk federations, 241 district unions, 28 marketing dairies,</p><p>25 Milk Producer Organisations (MPOs), covering approximately 2.35 lakh villages and 1.72 crore farmer-members.</p><p>31,908 dairy cooperative societies have been organised, integrating 17.63 lakh producers into formal value chains and increasing daily milk procurement by 120.68 lakh kilograms.</p><p>India is strengthening value addition through the planned expansion of milk processing capacity to 100 million litres per day by 2028–29, from the current 660 lakh litres per day, strengthening the sector’s contribution to food security and farm incomes.</p><p>Institutional Credit Support for Livestock</p><p>Access to affordable institutional credit has been instrumental in enabling livelihood diversification within the livestock and fisheries sectors, facilitating producers’ transition from subsistence-based operations to formal market integration. Under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, substantial credit support has been extended to allied activities to meet working capital requirements, promote asset formation, and reduce reliance on informal lending channels. The facts and figures indicate a strong institutional response to credit demand in allied agricultural activities.</p><p>In animal husbandry, the exceptionally high acceptance rate, 55.08 lakh out of 55.9 lakh applications, reflects effective screening mechanisms and sustained policy support. The sanctioning of 39.22 lakh applications further suggests substantial credit flow, translating into actual financial support.</p><p>Policy-led Intervention for India’s Fisheries Sector</p><p>Over the decade, India’s fisheries sector has recorded a sustained average annual growth rate of 8.74 percent, with total fish production increasing from 95.79 lakh tonnes in 2013–14 to 197.75 lakh tonnes in 2024–25. Inland fisheries and aquaculture have been the primary drivers of this expansion, registering a 147 percent increase from 61.36 lakh tonnes to 151.60 lakh tonnes during the same period.</p><p>The Union Budget 2026-27 allocated a record ₹2,761.80 crore (approximately USD 332.75 million) to fisheries, reinforcing sustained investment initiated under the Blue Revolution and consolidating India’s leadership in aquaculture and seafood exports. This trajectory underscores fisheries as a key growth engine within non-farm livelihood diversification, particularly in rural and coastal regions.</p><p>Deep-sea and offshore fisheries further integrate India into global seafood value chains, strengthening the sector’s economic and food security importance. This integration has been reinforced through focused interventions under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) and Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana (PM-MKSSY), under which seafood exports have more than doubled from ₹30,213 crore in 2013–14 to ₹62,408 crore in 2024–25, reaching over 130 countries.</p><p>Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) promotes fisheries development through infrastructure, modernization, and value chain strengthening to boost production, exports, jobs, and fishers’ incomes.</p><p>Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana (PM-MKSSY), a sub-scheme of PMMSY, supports sector formalisation through insurance, credit, performance incentives, and traceability to improve income security and sustainability for fish farmers.</p><p>Strengthening Fisheries Infrastructure and Market Access</p><p>Under PMSSY, Productivity gains have been accompanied by large-scale infrastructure development to reduce post-harvest losses and improve market access.</p><p>27,189 fish transportation and handling units established</p><p>6,733 fish retail markets and kiosks sanctioned</p><p>128 value-added enterprise units supported</p><p>To bridge infrastructure gaps, the Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF), launched in 2018–19 with a corpus of ₹7,522.48 crore, supports fishing harbours, landing centres, aquaculture units, and cold-chain logistics.</p><p>Institutional Credit Support for fisheries</p><p>In fisheries, 6.83 lakh applications were received under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC), of which 6.77 lakh were accepted. Of which, 4.82 lakh applications were sanctioned, indicating a meaningful conversion of demand into credit access. Financial inclusion and welfare programmes have extended KCC benefits to 4.39 lakh fishers, providing insurance coverage to 3.3 million beneficiaries, and delivering livelihood assistance to an average of 7.44 lakh fisher families during lean periods. These measures underscore the role of formal credit in enhancing resilience, stabilising incomes, and deepening integration with organised markets.</p><p>Sustainable Governance of Marine Fisheries and EEZ Resources</p><p>India’s extensive coastline of over 11,099 km and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of approximately 24 lakh square kilometres sustain the livelihoods of more than 50 lakh members of the fishing community across 13 maritime States and Union Territories. Marine fisheries constitute a strategic component of the blue economy, contributing to export earnings and national nutritional security.</p><p>To ensure responsible harnessing of aquatic resources, the Government has notified the Rules and Guidelines for Sustainable Harnessing of Fisheries in the EEZ and High Seas (2025), establishing a forward-looking regulatory framework aligned with sustainability and international compliance standards. Policy measures granting duty-free status to catch landed abroad and treated as exports aim to enhance price realisation and global competitiveness, while traceability, sustainability, and compliance safeguards mitigate misuse. The Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) further anchors sustainable export growth through quality assurance, market facilitation, capacity building, and ecological stewardship, reinforcing long-term resource security and livelihood resilience.</p><p>Mission-Driven Reservoir Development and Fisheries Value Chain Expansion</p><p>India possesses one of the world’s largest inland reservoir networks, spanning approximately 31.5 lakh hectares, which presents significant potential for expanding inland fisheries. Under Mission Amrit Sarovar, the Government of India has facilitated the development of 68,827 Amrit Sarovars, including 1,222 water bodies integrated with fisheries activities, thereby promoting fish culture, livelihood diversification, and the enhancement of aquatic ecosystems. The targeted interventions are proposed to integrate the development of 500 reservoirs and Amrit Sarovars to further consolidate the fisheries value chain, particularly across coastal and inland regions. These measures seek to strengthen market linkages and value addition by involving startups, women-led collectives, and Fish Farmer Producer Organizations (FFPOs), fostering inclusive growth, entrepreneurship, and sustainable fisheries-based livelihoods.</p><p>Data-driven Institutional Reform in Livestock and Fisheries Sectors</p><p>Digitalisation has become a critical instrument for enhancing efficiency, transparency, and producer welfare in the dairy sector. The introduction of the 12-digit unique livestock identification system, Pashu Aadhaar, has established a foundational digital architecture for recording animal health, breeding, and service delivery transactions, thereby enabling data-driven planning and real-time access for farmers and veterinarians.</p><p>By January 2026, more than 36.45 crore livestock had been registered on the Bharat Pashudhan Portal. Complementing this, the Automatic Milk Collection System (AMCS) has improved transparency in procurement through automated quality testing and pricing, ensuring timely payments.</p><p>The Internet-based Dairy Information System (i-DIS) further integrates data across unions and federations, enabling performance monitoring.</p><p>Operational in 12 States and Union Territories,</p><p>AMCS covers over 26,000 cooperative societies and benefits 17.3 lakh producers.</p><p>Parallel digital reforms in fisheries include the National Fisheries Digital Platform (NFDP), launched in 2024, under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana. NFDP creates digital identities and a unified national database for fishers and enterprises, facilitating access to credit, insurance, traceability, and performance incentives. With over 28 lakh stakeholders registered, integration of 12 banks on a common digital platform, and 217 loans disbursed, the platform advances formalisation, financial inclusion, and transparency in the fisheries value chain. Together, these digital platforms are reinforcing market integration, reducing transaction costs, and improving income certainty.</p><p>Sustainable Marine and Dairy Economies: Advancing Inclusive Growth and the SDGs</p><p>India’s marine and dairy economies constitute foundational pillars of sustainable livelihoods, nutritional security, and inclusive growth aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainable management of marine resources, aligned with SDG 14, is particularly critical given India’s EEZ exceeding 2 million square kilometres, necessitating effective governance of deep-sea and offshore fisheries to prevent overexploitation, conserve biodiversity, and safeguard food and livelihood security.</p><p>Complementing this, the dairy sector advances multiple social SDGs by sustaining the livelihoods of nearly 150 million farmers, particularly smallholders, thereby contributing to poverty reduction (SDG 1), productive employment (SDG 8), and reduced inequalities (SDG 10). Collectively, sustainable fisheries and inclusive dairy development reinforce integrated and equitable progress across key Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>India’s strategic focus on livelihood diversification through the dairy and fisheries sectors has successfully transitioned rural households from subsistence-oriented production to market-integrated, commercially viable models. Beyond enhancing farm incomes, diversification contributes to employment generation, risk mitigation, and the strengthening of food system resilience. India has emerged as the world leader in milk production and ranks second in fish and egg production, achieving significant productivity gains without necessarily increasing herd sizes. The expansion of cooperatives, Farmer-Producer Organizations (FPOs), and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) has deepened market integration, providing small producers with better bargaining power and structured value chains.</p><p>The deployment of digital public infrastructure, such as Pashu Aadhaar and the National Fisheries Digital Platform, alongside the expansion of Kisan Credit Cards (KCC), has enhanced transparency, reduced transaction costs, and provided essential liquidity to rural producers. These sectors are vital for the economic empowerment of women and smallholders, supporting livelihoods on a large scale, and aligning with global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for poverty reduction and environmental stewardship. Together, the convergence of productivity-led growth, institutional support, and technological innovation has created a resilient rural economy capable of withstanding seasonal and market shocks while ensuring national nutritional security.</p><p>Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying</p><p>https://nlm.udyamimitra.in/</p><p>https://dahd.gov.in/schemes/programmes/rashtriya_gokul_mission</p><p>https://bharatpashudhan.ndlm.co.in/</p><p>https://www.pmmsy.dof.gov.in/</p><p>https://pmmkssy.dof.gov.in/pmmkssy/#/</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2221582&reg=3&lang=1</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2213532&reg=3&lang=1</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=2212290&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2101856&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2184705&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2205031&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=2225246&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://mofpi.gov.in/sites/default/files/KnowledgeCentre/Sector%20Profile/Sector_Profile_Fisheries.pdf</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2221788&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2225763&reg=3&lang=1</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2225760&reg=3&lang=1</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=156127&ModuleId=3&reg=3&lang=1</p><p>https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/budget_speech.pdf</p><p>https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/doc/echapter.pdf</p><p>Ministry of Rural Development</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2122478&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI)</p><p>https://mofpi.gov.in/sites/default/files/KnowledgeCentre/Sector%20Profile/Sector_profile_Meat_Poultry_(1)22.pdf</p><p>Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Questions</p><p>https://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/185/AU4180_nfJzOf.pdf?source=pqals</p><p>https://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/185/AU2500_MY7k37.pdf?source=pqals</p><p>https://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/184/AU4923_3Zmrxj.pdf?source=pqals</p><p>https://sansad.in/getFile/annex/268/AU384_3ncA5j.pdf?source=pqars https://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/185/AS371_0BKEvo.pdf?source=pqals</p><p>https://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/186/AU2737_Zmswwv.pdf?source=pqals</p><p>https://sansad.in/getFile/annex/268/AU1181_cZK9ZJ.pdf?source=pqars</p><p>https://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/185/AU3729_txHX3D.pdf?source=pqals</p><p>Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)</p><p>https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/beee9189-d92d-4a0d-86af-a1e3328c33d1/content</p><p>https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/meat-eggs-and-milk-essential-source-of-nutrients-new-fao-report-says-250423/en</p><p>https://www.fao.org/fsnforum/consultation/eggs-nutrition?page=1</p><p>https://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2025-10/Indias-Blue-Economy-Strategy-For-Harnessing-Deep-Sea-And-Offshore-Fisheries.pdf</p><p>https://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2025-10/Reimagining_Agriculture_Roadmap_for_Frontier_Technology_Led_Transformation.pdf</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=156873&ModuleId=3&reg=3&lang=1</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2194086&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=155298&ModuleId=3&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2192114&reg=3&lang=2</p>",

    "summaryText": "<p>Text of PM’s address during the launch of various development projects in Puducherry</p><p>Chief Minister of Puducherry, Shri N. Rangasamy, My Union Cabinet colleague, Shri Mansukh Mandaviya, Lt. Governor of Puducherry, Shri K. Kailashnathan, Speaker, Shri R. Selvam, Home Minister, Shri A. Namassivayam, Other leaders, My dear sisters and brothers of Puducherry, Vanakkam!</p><p>It is an honour to be here in Puducherry. This is the land of Siddhar, saints, poets and freedom fighters. This is where Mahakavi Subramania Bharati ignited the fire of nationalism. From here, Sri Aurobindo and The Mother gave a new spiritual vision for the whole world.</p><p>When I came here earlier, I had given the mantra of BEST Puducherry. BEST means Business, Education, Spirituality and Tourism. In the last four and a half years, this vision is bearing fruit. Puducherry has witnessed good governance and development. When the Centre and the UT work with the same vision and dedication, results are faster and better. Puducherry has shown an impressive rise in per capita income. It has also achieved the highest Social Progress Index score in the country. Now, the double-engine NDA government will add more momentum to Puducherry’s growth. Today, projects worth more than Two Thousand Seven Hundred Crore Rupees are being inaugurated and foundation stones are being laid. These projects will transform the lives of the people.</p><p>Across India, there is a great emphasis on building top-quality infrastructure. In this year’s budget, we have set aside a record Twelve Lakh Crore Rupees for building infrastructure. This will also benefit the people of Puducherry. We included Puducherry under the Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment Scheme, which used to be open only for states. More funding for infrastructure means better roads, water supply, coastal infrastructure, schools, hospitals and many such projects. These facilities directly make the lives of the people better.</p><p>A strong and empowered youth is the foundation of our growth. We are working to support their dreams. At NIT Karaikal, the new Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Engineering Block and modern hostel facilities will strengthen technical education for many students. Infrastructure upgrades have been done in Pondicherry University. Its new lecture halls, girls’ hostels and other infrastructure will help students. I am told that thousands of vacancies in various departments of the Puducherry government have been filled. For many of these posts, direct recruitment examinations had not been conducted for decades. But the double engine government got it done. I congratulate all youth who have joined to serve the people.</p><p>Today, the world is focussing on mobility that is cleaner and greener. Electric vehicles have become an important part of our life. In a tourism hub like Puducherry, electric buses can be a gamechanger in reducing pollution. Under PM e-Bus Sewa, electric buses are being provided today. The housing projects related to our programme today will give families stability and dignity. There are projects worth several hundred crores across Puducherry, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam which will help people. Water desalination plants will ensure clean drinking water. New Sewage Treatment Plants will improve waste management. The government is also working to reduce flooding and waterlogging during monsoons. All our efforts are towards providing Ease of Living for the people of Puducherry. यहाँ कुछ बच्चे बढ़िया-बढ़िया चित्र बनाकर ले आए हैं। जरा एसपीजी के लोगों से कहूँगा, जरा उसको कलेक्ट कर लें। Thank you my friends, Thank you Very Much. Please collect all the gifts.</p><p>Any nation can progress only when its human capital is healthy. That is why healthcare remains our foremost priority. We believe that healthcare should be accessible, available and affordable to all. Ayushman Bharat scheme is already fulfilling this vision for crores of families across India. No citizen of Puducherry should be forced to travel far for treatment. Instead, we want people of other regions to come here to heal. I strongly believe that Puducherry can become a medical tourism hub. Puducherry already has nine medical colleges. The modernisation of the Regional Cancer Centre at JIPMER will further expand healthcare capacity. Today, the foundation stone has been laid for three Critical Care Blocks for critically ill patients under PM-ABHIM. These new Critical Care Blocks in Puducherry and Karaikal will significantly enhance emergency capacity. Puducherry is known for Siddha medicine and holistic healthcare. The new Integrated AYUSH Hospital in Karaikal will serve the people.</p><p>Connectivity is the backbone of progress. We are focusing both on rural and urban infrastructure. On one hand, hundreds of kilometres of rural roads are being built. They are improving connectivity for students, farmers, workers and small businesses. At the same time, we are also working to ensure decongestion of Puducherry. We have announced projects worth over One Thousand Crore Rupees in Puducherry Town. This includes a flyover worth Four Hundred And Forty Crore Rupees.</p><p>Connectivity to Chennai is being improved through upgrades in the East Coast Road and Grand Southern Trunk Road. Travel time between Puducherry and Chennai will reduce to about 1.5-2 hours. The Puducherry to Cuddalore National Highway is already completed and the Karaikal National Highway is being upgraded. We are investing more than Thirty Thousand Crore Rupees in road projects in the East Coast Corridor up to Kanyakumari. These projects link parts of Puducherry to major economic hubs like Chennai, Bengaluru and Coimbatore. Such connectivity will significantly boost tourism, trade and industry.</p><p>Tourism is one of Puducherry’s greatest strengths. As a weekend destination, it already attracts thousands of people. Trains and flights are always full. It is due to the warmth of the people of Puducherry that this is happening. With investments in spiritual tourism, eco-tourism and health tourism, we are taking this to new heights. Under the PRASHAD Scheme, development of pilgrimage facilities at various temples is being done. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother saw Auroville as the Universal City of Consciousness. I am happy to know that a Global Spiritual Mahotsav is beginning today in Auroville. Such gatherings unite people across regions and religions.</p><p>It is important to celebrate the good work that is being done by the double engine government. But it is also important to remember how things were earlier. The people of Puducherry suffered immensely during Congress-DMK rule. Those years were marked by political instability, corruption, crime and suffering of the poor. Ration shops had no rice. Salaries were delayed. Goons and drug mafias ruled the streets.</p><p>Congress had made Puducherry an ATM for one family that sits in Delhi. When it comes to DMK, you are seeing the long list of scams that are happening in Tamil Nadu also. Congress and DMK had become a speed breaker in Puducherry’s development journey. Now the same forces are hungry for power again. Should Puducherry go back to that era of corruption and crime? I am sure the people of Puducherry do not want that.</p><p>Puducherry has been such an important part of our freedom struggle. Many leaders were born here. Some of them came here and worked from here. This land has been crucial to India getting freedom in 1947. Now, by 2047, we must create a developed Puducherry and a developed India. The double engine government of Puducherry is with you in this mission. We will keep working for BEST Puducherry.</p><p>Read this release in: Urdu , Manipuri , Gujarati</p>",

The Vice-President also cited historical evidence of the vibrant musical culture of ancient South India, including inscriptions in the Brihadisvara Temple built by the Chola kings, which record the appointment and support of hundreds of musicians and dancers. He noted that sacred hymns such as the Thevaram were regularly rendered in temples, demonstrating the timelessness of Bharat’s musical heritage. Speaking about India’s diverse musical traditions, the Vice-President described Hindustani and Carnatic classical music as profound sciences of sound. He recalled the immortal compositions of Tyagaraja, the genius of Tansen, the divine voice of M. S. Subbulakshmi, and the global influence of Ravi Shankar, noting that Indian music has inspired audiences across continents. Observing that all music Western or Indian is built upon seven notes, he said the Sapta Swaras resonate with human emotions, regulate breathing, steady the heartbeat, reduce stress, and enhance concentration. “When a beautiful raga flows at dawn or a devotional hymn fills a sacred space, music becomes medicine,” he remarked. The Vice-President appreciated the vision of Chetana Ganashram as an eco-friendly music campus dedicated to music meditation and therapy. He noted that the seven notes symbolize unity in diversity each distinct, yet harmonious together, offering a profound lesson for humanity. He commended the Ganashram’s inclusive management involving people of different faiths, including noted personalities such as Singer Shri K. J. Yesudas, and appreciated its efforts to bring people together under the spiritual umbrella of music and meditation. Highlighting the five proposed alayams ,Dhyana-alayam (Music Meditation), Sangeet-alayam (Neurologic Music Therapy), Sabd-alayam (Voice Therapy), Kala-alayam (Indian Music and Dance), and Yoga-alayam (Yoga Therapy), the Vice-President expressed confidence that the institution would awaken and heal many souls. He further stated that under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the ancient wisdom of Yoga has gained unprecedented global recognition and has emerged as a symbol of India’s soft power, reflecting the philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, the world is one family. He added that the Central Government has created vibrant platforms for the exchange of musical traditions, strengthening unity in diversity and enhancing global appreciation for India’s cultural heritage. Concluding his address, the Vice-President emphasized that in today’s fast-moving and often stressful world, the healing power of music is more relevant than ever. He wished Chetana Ganashram great success and expressed hope that the eternal vibrations of Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni would continue to heal hearts and guide humanity towards harmony. The ceremony was attended by the Governor of Kerala, Shri Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar; Union Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas & Tourism, Shri Suresh Gopi; Minister for Higher Education and Social Justice, Government of Kerala, Dr. R. Bindu; Mayor of Thrissur Corporation, Dr. Niji Justin; Archbishop of Thrissur, Mar Andrews Thazath; Provincial, CMI Devamatha Province, Thrissur, Dr. Jose Nandhikkara; and Executive Director, Chetana Gaana-Ashram, Dr. Paul Poovathingal, among other dignitaries.</p><p>Read this release in: Urdu , हिन्दी , Tamil , Malayalam</p>",

    "summaryText": "<p>India's Transformation into a Global Health Powerhouse</p><p>Universal Coverage — Ayushman Bharat provides free/subsidised care to hundreds of millions through insurance, 184,000+ primary healthcare centres, and 863 million digital health IDs.</p><p>Pharmacy of the World — India supplies 20% of global generic medicines and 55–60% of UNICEF's vaccines, with a bioeconomy growing toward $300B by 2030.</p><p>Tech & Innovation — AI diagnostics, drone deliveries, and homegrown vaccines are extending care to the hardest-to-reach populations.</p><p>From conquering longstanding public health challenges to becoming a leading force in affordable medicines and global healthcare delivery, India’s rise as a global health powerhouse stands as a testament to visionary leadership, resilient institutions, and the unwavering commitment of the Government of India to building a healthier, stronger, and more prosperous nation. The Government runs flagship schemes that provide public health insurance, free healthcare and services across all levels and subsidised medicines, along with a widespread and accessible health infrastructure. The guiding principle is to provide universal health coverage – ensuring that everyone, including the most socio-economically disadvantaged populations, gets access to affordable and quality healthcare so that India can progress towards its goal of being a healthy, productive and prosperous society – a Viksit or developed Bharat – by 2047.</p><p>India's medical education system, comprising private colleges along with publicly funded institutions, has seen expansion and growth over the years. India's pharmaceutical sector, the world's third largest by volume, enables a ready supply of affordable medicines not just to Indian citizens but also to the world – as evidenced by India's prowess in manufacturing and supplying COVID-19 vaccines. India's biopharmaceutical sector is growing in leaps and bounds, supported by government investment and private industry's innovative spirit. India has been witnessing a rise in medical tourists, from over 112,000 in 2009 to over 600,000 in 2024. To enhance India’s medical tourism sector, the Government of India in its Union Budget 2026-27 announced the establishment of five integrated medical hubs across India featuring diagnostic infrastructure and rehabilitation services in partnership with the private sector. India is now poised to contribute more significantly to global public health – a remarkable achievement for a country that was battling endemic diseases not even a century ago.</p><p>Providing Universal Health Coverage: Ayushman Bharat</p><p>The Government of India’s flagship scheme – Ayushman Bharat (Long Live India) – is key to its aim in providing universal health coverage to all, particularly the socio-economically backward and vulnerable sections of the Indian society. This umbrella scheme has various components that work together to ensure that people get access to quality healthcare at all levels – primary, secondary and tertiary levels.</p><p>It’s four major components include</p><p>AB-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), the world’s largest publicly funded health assurance scheme.</p><p>Ayushman Arogya Mandir for upgrading sub health centres and primary health centres.</p><p>Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM) - the largest pan-India scheme for strengthening healthcare infrastructure across the country.</p><p>Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM), which forms the backbone for a citizen centric interoperable digital health ecosystem.</p><p>Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (Prime Minister’s People Health Programme)</p><p>The Government of India launched the Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) on September 23, 2018, to achieve universal health care. It is the world’s largest public healthcare scheme with hundreds of millions of vulnerable Indian families enrolled in it.</p><p>AB-PMJAY provides healthcare coverage up to Rs. 5 lakhs per year (~$5,000 USD) for secondary and tertiary care services and hospitalisation to enrolled socio-economically deprived families and to all senior citizens above 70 years, saving them from catastrophic medical bills. The scheme provides cashless treatment across empanelled government-funded and private hospitals. The scheme is aimed at the bottom 40% of the Indian population, covering 120 million people, with over 434 million Ayushman cards already made.</p><p>The scheme has helped reduce the healthcare expenditure of families by increasing government spending on health insurance. The savings for families was over Rs. 1.25 lakh crore (2024-2025) (~$13.77 billion USD).</p><p>The allocation for the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana has been raised to Rs. 9,500 crore (~$1.05 billion USD) in Budget Estimates 2026–27, up by Rs. 500 crore (~$55 million USD) or 5.56% over the Revised Estimates of Financial Year 2025–26. This increase aims to expand beneficiary coverage, improve service quality, and strengthen hospital networks.</p><p>While AB-PMJAY supports secondary and tertiary healthcare, the Ayushman Bharat scheme runs various other programmes to ensure quality primary healthcare and a robust healthcare infrastructure which is accessible to all.</p><p>A strong primary care infrastructure ensures health equity and access. Ayushman Arogya Mandirs are primary health care centres under the Ayushman Bharat scheme that provide a wide range of general health services for people close to their homes.</p><p>There are 1,84,235 AAMs across the country (as on February 27, 2026), including in the urban, rural and tribal-dominated areas. There are 30,817 AAMs in 178 tribal districts across 26 states and 24,327 AAMs in 112 aspirational districts across 27 states (as on December 31, 2025).</p><p>To ensure healthcare access, teleconsultations are also provided at AAMs – 426.6 million consultations have been conducted last year (as on December 31, 2025).</p><p>AAMs are where the community can access preventive and promotive healthcare. Over 58 million wellness sessions with yoga were also held at AAMs for the holistic development of people. The ministry screens millions of people for various non-communicable diseases under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases. As on October 31, 2025, these are the number of screenings for various ailments:</p><p>Hypertension Screenings: 401.3 million</p><p>Diabetes Screenings: 398.6 million</p><p>Oral Cancer Screenings: 338.3 million</p><p>Breast Cancer Screenings: 158.6 million</p><p>Pradhan Mantri-Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission</p><p>Recognising the vital role of AAMs in mitigating and controlling the impact of pandemics or other disease outbreaks, the Government of India launched the Pradhan Mantri–Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM) in 2021. PM-ABHIM looks at infrastructure in health, research and surveillance.</p><p>PM-ABHIM aims at strengthening the health infrastructure from the grassroots to the district level through establishment and upgradation of the following in every district:</p><p>Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs)</p><p>Integrated District Public Health Labs</p><p>Critical Care Hospital Blocks</p><p>PM-ABHIM also prioritises pandemic and disaster preparedness by expanding an IT-enabled, real-time disease surveillance network that integrates laboratories at block, district, regional, and national levels to detect, investigate, and prevent outbreaks effectively.</p><p>The Government of India approved Rs. 32,928.82 crore (~$3.63 billion USD) for a 5-year period from the fiscal years 2021-22 to 2025-26. This fund is for the construction, upgradation and establishment of:</p><p>9,519 building-less sub health centres–Ayushman Arogya Mandirs</p><p>2,151 block public health units</p><p>744 integrated public health laboratories</p><p>622 critical care blocks at district hospitals and government medical colleges</p><p>Digital Initiatives – Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission and Technology Integrations</p><p>The Ayushman Bharat also supports the creation of a robust digital public infrastructure through the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM), one of the most ambitious digital health architectures in the world. Beneficiaries are assigned a unique health identification number, under the Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) system, enabling their medical records to be securely stored and accessed online through a “digital health locker”.</p><p>Over 863 million ABHAs have been created to date (as on February 27, 2026). Through an app, users can also connect with registered healthcare professionals. Verified healthcare professionals can treat patients remotely through teleconsultations and review digital health records. This digital ecosystem enables the last-mile health coverage.</p><p>India runs one of the world’s largest digital mental health initiatives, operating 53 cells across all 36 states and union territories with 24x7 counselling services in 20 languages and having handled over 3.28 million. Launched on October 10, 2022, Tele MANAS has further expanded accessibility with support in 12 languages, providing comprehensive mental health support from general well-being to disorder management.</p><p>Revolutionising Healthcare Access: Drone-Based Delivery of Medical Services</p><p>Pilot projects using drones are in process. In 2021, the Indian Council of Medical Research launched the 'i-DRONE' initiative to test drone-based delivery of vaccines and medical supplies to hard-to-reach areas in the mountainous states of Manipur and Nagaland. Following successful pilots across diverse terrains, the programme expanded nationwide with specialized applications: high-altitude medical deliveries in Himachal Pradesh (above 10,000 feet), TB sample transport in Telangana to reduce diagnostic time, pathological sample transfers in Karnataka for time-sensitive cases, and blood product transportation studies in Delhi NCR. These initiatives demonstrate how drones can strengthen last-mile healthcare connectivity, accelerate diagnostics, and provide critical medical logistics support in challenging geographies.</p><p>Apart from the umbrella Ayushman Bharat scheme, the Government of India has been running the National Health Mission for decades, with its two components – the National Urban Health Mission and the National Rural Health Mission – for the prevention, mitigation and treatment of various kinds of diseases. The National Health Mission (NHM) has significantly contributed to improving India's public health outcomes through its relentless efforts in expanding human resources, addressing critical health issues, and fostering an integrated response to health emergencies.</p><p>The NHM works to improve maternal, child, and adolescent health through programmes including immunisation, strengthens health systems by improving quality standards, and manages a range of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) control programmes.</p><p>Universal Immunisation Programme</p><p>The Universal Immunisation Program (UIP) is one of the largest public health programs targeting close of 26.7 million newborns and 29 million pregnant women annually free of cost.</p><p>Strategic interventions like advocacy, social mobilisation, inter-personal communication at the family level by community health workers and media engagement are some measures utilised to improve immunisation coverage. Community health workers called the Accredited Social Health Activists and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives conducted over 13 million immunisation sessions across the country. There are over 1.03 million ASHAs working under the NHM across the country (as of April 4, 2025).</p><p>The 11 vaccines given under the programme are:</p><p>Bacillus Calmette-Guérin Vaccine (BCG)</p><p>Injectable Polio Vaccine (IPV)</p><p>Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV)</p><p>Measles & Rubella Vaccine (MR)</p><p>Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus Vaccine (DPT)</p><p>Tetanus & Adult Diphtheria Vaccine (Td) and</p><p>Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine (JE)</p><p>HPV Vaccination Programme Launched</p><p>The Government of India launched a three-month nationwide HPV Vaccination Programme on February 28, 2026, for the prevention of cervical cancer among women. The Gardasil-4 vaccine, which is a single-dose, WHO pre-qualified vaccine used in immunisation programmes across the world, is now being given to adolescent girls aged 14 years, free of cost, at all government primary and community health centres, district and sub-district hospitals, and government medical colleges and hospitals across the country through central-state/UT government collaboration. Gardasil-4, a quadrivalent HPV vaccine protects against HPV types 16 and 18 (which cause cervical cancer), as well as types 6 and 11.</p><p>About 11.5 million girls are presently eligible for the vaccine. The 90-day vaccination drive is running daily to ensure maximum coverage and will thereafter be available on routine immunisation days. This nationwide HPV vaccination campaign is a pivotal step towards empowering India’s women and safeguarding the health of mothers and daughters across the country. With this landmark campaign, India has joined over 160 countries with HPV vaccination programmes.</p><p>Mission Indradhanush was launched on December 25, 2014 under the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) to immunise children and pregnant women who have either missed or dropped out of routine immunisation schedules, focusing on regions with low vaccination coverage.</p><p>As a result of the continued, sustained efforts and intensified implementation of vaccination drives and campaign across the country, the percentage of zero-dose children to the total population has declined from 0.11% in 2023 to 0.06% in 2024.Recent data on MI vaccination numbers.</p><p>Other NHM Programmes, Infrastructure and Impact</p><p>Other than the immunisation programme, the National Health Mission runs a wide network of programmes for all kinds of ailments and health conditions.</p><p>Increase in NHM funding and capacity building has resulted in the improvement of India’s public health indicators over the past few decades.</p><p>Key Achievements of National Health Mission:</p><p>COVID-19: Over 2.2 billion vaccine doses administered nationwide</p><p>Maternal Health: Maternal Mortality Ratio declined by 83% since 1990, surpassing the global decline of 45%</p><p>Child Health: Under-5 Mortality Rate reduced by 75% since 1990, higher than the global reduction of 60%</p><p>Tuberculosis: TB incidence reduced from 237 per 1,00,000 population in 2015 to 195 in 2023; over 940,000 TB patients supported by 156,000 Ni-kshay Mitra volunteers under the Pradhan Mantri TB Mukt Bharat Abhiyan</p><p>Measles-Rubella: 97.98% vaccination coverage achieved under the Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) 5.0; over 347.7 million children vaccinated</p><p>Sickle Cell Anaemia: Over 26.1 million individuals screened in tribal areas under the National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission</p><p>Dialysis: Over 220,000 patients have availed dialysis services and over 2.5 million hemodialysis sessions held under the scheme (as on June 30, 2024).</p><p>Tobacco Control: 17.3% reduction in tobacco use over the past decade</p><p>Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare</p><p>From 2022 to 2025, India has fundamentally restructured its public health delivery by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into a unified strategy, that bridges specialist shortages and scales proactive care. In February 2026 during the AI Summit in New Delhi, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare launched the Strategy for AI in Healthcare for India (SAHI), the first nation in the South-Eastern region to do so. The strategy encourages innovation and rapid increase in the application of AI in healthcare, while emphasising ethical use and conduct. The Government of India has already integrated AI into its ABDM infrastructure and other programmes.</p><p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly being operationalised across disease areas and health system functions in India. Some examples are:</p><p>Eka Doc, a clinic management system, is an ABDM-enabled application that supports triaging, protocol searching, and summarising patient records for doctors; it has triaged over one million patients and summarised over 1.7 million records.</p><p>Sunoh.AI by eClinicalWorks is an AI-powered scribing tool that enables doctors to create electronic prescriptions using voice technology, supporting the creation of hundreds of thousands of ePrescriptions.</p><p>In tuberculosis management, an Adverse Outcome Prediction tool uses predictive analytics to flag patients at high risk of treatment failure at the time treatment is initiated, with a reported 27% decline in adverse outcomes following nationwide deployment.</p><p>For diabetes-related eye care, MadhuNetrAI enables non-specialists to take retinal photographs which are then graded by AI to prioritise urgent specialist referrals; launched in December 2025 as India's first AI-based community screening programme, it has benefited 7,100 patients across 38 facilities.</p><p>Making Medicines Affordable</p><p>Apart from making healthcare more accessible and affordable, the Government of India makes available quality generic medicines at affordable prices through the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP). The medicines are available at the 17,990 Janaushadhi Kendras country wide. Over 2,000 medicines and 315 surgical products are available at the Kendras and are sold at 50-90% lower rates than the market price. These medicines provide treatment for a range of diseases and ailments, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and others. The scheme has saved beneficiaries about Rs. 30,000 crores (~$3.31 billion USD) in the past decade.</p><p>To complement the PMBJP, the government launched the Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) initiative, aimed specifically at supporting tertiary healthcare. AMRIT Pharmacies act as centralised supply points for branded, branded-generic, and generic drugs, as well as surgical items, consumables, and medical implants—especially those required for high-end treatments. There are 255 pharmacies in India, with a vision to expand this network to 500 outlets across the country (as of November 2025).</p><p>India’s strong pharmaceutical sector, the 3rd largest in the world by volume, has enabled it to become the largest supplier of generic medicines providing 20% of the world’s supply. The country exports to about 200 countries and territories. India is also a key player in affordable vaccines.</p><p>For the Global South, India's pharmaceutical supplies – low cost and of good quality – provides essential health security. The country currently supplies over 70% of global anti-retroviral medicines, ensuring affordable access for nations in need.</p><p>The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), along with the National Regulatory Authority of India (NRA) and affiliated institutions, were found to meet the World Health Organisation’s published indicators for a functional vaccine regulatory system in October 2024.</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, India developed indigenous vaccines including Covaxin and Covishield, demonstrating its unique capacity to integrate research and large-scale production.</p><p>India's pharmaceutical sector has long been a global vaccine supplier, providing 55–60% of UNICEF's vaccines and meeting a significant share of global demand for DPT, BCG, and measles vaccines, saving millions of lives across continents.</p><p>India is now using biotechnology to manufacture high-value biologics, biosimilars and innovative therapeutics. India's bio-economy sector has seen a 13-fold increase over the past decade, from $10 billion USD in 2014 to over $165.7 billion USD in 2024 and is projected to reach $300 billion USD by 2030.</p><p>The Union Budget 2026–27 lunched of Biopharma SHAKTI, designed to strengthen India's end-to-end ecosystem for biologics and biosimilars through investments in domestic manufacturing, workforce development, a nationwide network of over 1,000 accredited clinical trial sites, and enhanced regulatory capacity at the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO). Three new National Institutes of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPERs) will be established, and seven existing ones upgraded, to meet the growing demand for specialised human resources in biopharma. This initiative, along with existing National Biopharma Mission, aims to catalyse India's global role in the next industrial revolution and establish India as a global biomanufacturing hub.</p><p>The National Biopharma Mission (NBM)—\"Innovate in India (i3)\"—has already catalysed transformative outcomes since its launch in 2017. Co-funded by the World Bank and implemented by the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), the Mission supports 101 projects involving over 150 organisations and has generated more than 1,000 jobs, including 304 scientists and researchers. Breakthroughs include India's first indigenously developed MRI scanner at a fraction of the cost of imported machines, the country's first biosimilar of Liraglutide for Type 2 diabetes priced at nearly one-third of the imported version, and the world's first DNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, ZyCoV-D, developed by Zydus Cadila. These innovations are India’s contribution to making quality healthcare more affordable.</p><p>Health Education Expansion</p><p>Due to the growing medical sector and rising demand for services, the Government of India is systematically expanding medical education to keep pace. Over the past 11 years, the Government of India made gains in making quality medical education more accessible. There are now 23 publicly funded and leading All India Institute of Medical Sciences institutes, including the first-ever AIIMS in the northeastern area in Assam. There are 2,045 medical colleges, including 780 allopathy, 323 dental and 942 AYUSH institutions. Medical education seats for the MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) increased by 130% (from 51,348 to 118,190), and postgraduate seats grew by 138% (from 31,185 to 74,306).</p><p>India's transformation from a nation battling endemic diseases to a global medical tourism hub and health technology leader demonstrates what strategic government intervention can achieve. The infrastructure built—from over 180,000 Ayushman Arogya Mandirs to the world's largest digital health ecosystem with over 860 million health IDs—has not only improved health outcomes domestically but positioned India as a destination for quality, affordable healthcare worldwide. As the nation moves toward its 2047 vision of Viksit Bharat, the foundation is firmly in place: robust public health systems, cutting-edge digital architecture, and an unwavering commitment to ensuring that every citizen, regardless of geography or income, has access to quality healthcare—making India a model for health equity in the developing world.</p><p>https://www.who.int/campaigns/universal-health-coverage-day/2025</p><p>https://knowindia.india.gov.in/profile/directive-principles-of-state-policy.php</p><p>chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.mea.gov.in/images/pdf1/part4.pdf</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2222493&reg=3&lang=1</p><p>https://scosta.gov.in/ministry-of-labor-and-employment-rsby/</p><p>https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/primary-health-care#:~:text=PHC%20addresses%20the%20broader%20determinants,feasible%20to%20people's%20everyday%20environment.</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2224515&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://dashboard.abdm.gov.in/abdm/</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/FactsheetDetails.aspx?Id=149066&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://nhpr.abdm.gov.in/nhpr/v4/home</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2189415&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2074630&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/yaws-eradication#:~:text=WHO%20certifies%20India%20as%20free,country%20as%20free%20of%20yaws</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=147093&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://mohfw.gov.in/?q=en/pressrelease-102</p><p>Economic Survey 2025-26: chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/doc/Infographics%20English.pdf</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2185049&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2087878&reg=3&lang=2#:~:text=Both%2C%20Malaria%20cases%20and%20deaths,of%20India's%20malaria%20control%20efforts.</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=2224451&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2233632&reg=3&lang=1#:~:text=Cervical%20cancer%20remains%20the%20second,per%20the%20GLOBOCAN%202022%20data</p><p>https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer</p><p>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12702179/</p><p>https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/basic-information.html</p><p>https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/gavi-and-government-india-establish-new-partnership-protect-millions-children-2026</p><p>Read this release in: Bengali</p>",

Senior officials from Central Ministries, State Governments, State Designated Agencies (SDAs), and partner institutions were also present.</p><p>Recalling the famous saying, “Prevention is better than cure,” Shri Manohar Lal remarked that the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) functions as a preventive institution for the power sector. Every unit of electricity conserved today directly contributes to reducing the need for additional generation capacity and lowering emissions. By adopting energy-efficient practices, we not only protect the environment but also secure a cleaner and more sustainable future for coming generations. He also lauded BEE for its significant contribution to advancing energy efficiency initiatives in the country.</p><p>Shri Manohar Lal highlighted India’s significant progress in meeting its climate commitments and strengthening energy efficiency as a core pillar of national development. He noted that India has reduced the emissions intensity of its GDP by 36% from 2005 levels and achieved 52% non-fossil fuel installed capacity ahead of the 2030 target.</p><p>He outlined key achievements under major BEE initiatives, including the Renewable Consumption Obligation (RCO), the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) Scheme, the transition to the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE), the ADEETIE scheme for MSMEs, the Standards & Labelling (S&L) Programme, the Energy Conservation and Sustainable Building Code (ECSBC), and transport sector efficiency measures.</p><p>Emphasising the way forward, he underscored the role of energy efficiency in achieving the vision of Viksit Bharat @2047, while drawing attention to emerging areas such as data centres and Artificial Intelligence, which require efficient and sustainable energy management solutions.</p><p>Shri Pankaj Agarwal, Secretary (Power), outlined the evolving contours of India’s energy landscape, marked by rising demand, expanding non-fossil capacity, and increasing digitalisation. He described energy efficiency as India’s “First Fuel” and a key instrument for balancing energy security, affordability, and sustainability.</p><p>He highlighted BEE’s initiatives in cooling efficiency through S&L and ECSBC, industrial decarbonisation through the Carbon Market and the ADEETIE scheme, the establishment of energy efficiency hubs, and fuel efficiency improvements in the transport sector.</p><p>Earlier, delivering his welcome address, Shri Krushna Chandra Panigrahy, Director General, BEE, reflected on the Bureau’s journey and reaffirmed its commitment to accelerating energy efficiency adoption across all sectors of the economy.</p><p>On the occasion, the BEE@25 logo was formally released to mark BEE’s entry into its 25th year. The logo symbolically reflects the core principles of energy efficiency, sustainability, and forward-looking innovation. The design prominently integrates the “@25” motif to signify the milestone year while incorporating visual elements that represent energy, growth, and environmental responsibility. The dynamic styling and colour scheme convey continuity, impact, and the Bureau’s evolving role in India’s energy transition. The commemorative logo will be used across official communications, outreach campaigns, publications, and awareness initiatives throughout the year, serving as the visual identity for the 25th year celebrations and reinforcing BEE’s commitment to advancing energy efficiency as a national priority.</p><p>A specially curated BEE Journey Video was screened during the event, highlighting the Bureau’s evolution over the past twenty-four years, its major milestones, flagship programmes, institutional partnerships, and its contribution to strengthening India’s energy efficiency ecosystem.</p><p>During the event, the RCO Portal (http://www.rco.beeindia.gov.in) was unveiled as a significant step towards strengthening monitoring, facilitating compliance, and streamlining coordination among stakeholders under various energy efficiency programmes. The portal is expected to enhance transparency, improve reporting mechanisms, and support data-driven decision-making within the implementation framework.</p><p>The Minister also launched the BEE Star Label Mobile Application, developed in collaboration with CLASP. The application will enable consumers to scan the QR code affixed to star-labelled appliances to instantly access authentic product information, including energy performance, model details, and compliance status. The app aims to enhance transparency, strengthen consumer awareness, and promote informed purchasing decisions by making energy efficiency information easily accessible at the point of sale. This initiative is expected to further reinforce the credibility of the Standards & Labelling Programme and encourage greater adoption of energy-efficient appliances across the country.</p><p>The celebration also featured a fireside interaction with former Directors General of BEE, moderated by Dr Satish Kumar, President and Executive Director of the Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE). Retired officials of State Designated Agencies were felicitated for their dedicated service and valuable contributions to advancing energy conservation initiatives at the State level.</p><p>The 25th Foundation Day celebration reaffirmed BEE’s continued resolve to promote energy efficiency as a driver of sustainable growth, national energy security, and environmental responsibility, and to pave the way for a Viksit and Atmanirbhar Bharat.</p><p>Read this release in: Urdu , हिन्दी</p>",
