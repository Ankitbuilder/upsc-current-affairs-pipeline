Today, it comprises 16 faculties, 86 departments, 90 colleges, 20 halls and hostels, more than 30 centres and institutes, 34 libraries, and over six lakh students. “Delhi University has indeed come a long way in its historic journey,” he remarked.</p><p>Appreciating the scale of the ceremony, the Vice-President remarked that the total number of graduating students is more than the population of many countries, reflecting the vast academic footprint of the University.</p><p>Describing the University as one of India’s most distinguished institutions of higher learning, the Vice-President said that for over a century it has nurtured minds that have gone on to lead India’s intellectual, political, scientific, and cultural life. He told the graduating students that they now join a remarkable lineage of alumni who have shaped not only India but the world.</p><p>Highlighting the University’s growing academic stature, he expressed satisfaction over its consistently improving national and international rankings. He noted that the University has retained the number one position among Indian universities in the QS World University Rankings for four consecutive years.</p><p>The Vice-President said that Convocation is not merely a ceremonial event; it marks both an ending and a beginning. It celebrates years of study, discipline, friendships, examinations, and self-discovery, while also signalling the graduates’ formal induction into a larger arena, the arena of responsibility.</p><p>He observed that the graduates are stepping into a world undergoing profound transformation. Technology is reshaping industries, artificial intelligence is redefining the nature of work, climate change is challenging models of growth, and democracies across the globe are being tested. In such a world, he said, a degree is not just a certificate but a commitment, a commitment to serve society, to use one’s skills for the greater good, to live not only for oneself but also for the betterment of the nation, and above all, to uphold the principle of “Nation First -Rashtra Pratham.”</p><p>Referring to India’s journey towards Viksit Bharat @ 2047, the Vice-President said that at this crucial juncture, the role of the youth assumes even greater significance. Under the leadership and vision of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, he said, India has articulated the aspiration of becoming an Aatmanirbhar Bharat and building a Viksit Bharat ,a developed India by 2047, when the nation will celebrate 100 years of Independence.</p><p>He emphasized that Aatmanirbharta is the capacity to innovate, manufacture, research, and create solutions rooted in Indian realities yet globally competitive. It calls upon universities to become engines of research, entrepreneurship, and indigenous knowledge systems. Viksit Bharat, he added, stands for inclusive growth, technological leadership, social harmony, environmental sustainability, and transparent and accountable institutions. It aims to ensure that development reaches the last citizen and that opportunity becomes a promise to all.</p><p>Addressing the graduates as architects of this vision, the Vice-President said that whether they become scientists, civil servants, entrepreneurs, artists, lawyers, teachers, or innovators, they will shape the India of 2047. The realization of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and Viksit Bharat, he said, will depend on their integrity, competence, compassion, and innovative spirit.</p><p>The Vice-President expressed happiness that over 50 percent of graduates and more than 70 percent of the gold medallists are women. He also noted that the number of women receiving degrees this year exceeds that of men. He described this as a reflection of the phenomenal growth of women’s education in India. He extended his blessings and best wishes to all graduating students for their well-deserved success earned through sustained hard work.</p><p>In his concluding remarks, the Vice-President urged the graduates to carry forward the spirit of inquiry and to remember that learning is a lifelong process. He called upon them to remain grateful for the opportunities they have received and mindful of the responsibilities that accompany them. He also urged them to say “No to Drugs” and to use social media constructively rather than becoming enslaved by it.</p><p>The convocation was attended by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Delhi, Prof. Yogesh Singh, faculty members, other dignitaries, and students.</p>",

    "headline": "The Evolving Spectrum of Energy Sources",
    "summaryText": "<p>The Evolving Spectrum of Energy Sources</p><p>Every day, as lights turn on across homes, schools, farms, factories, and hospitals, we rarely think about where that energy comes from. The fan that cools a classroom, the pump that waters a field, and the train that carries passengers all depend on a vast and carefully managed energy system working silently in the background.</p><p>Today, that system in India is changing. As the country advances, the focus is on ensuring reliable, affordable, cleaner, and more secure energy for every household and enterprise.</p><p>Improved power availability has been a key outcome of ongoing reforms. The average electricity availability in rural areas has increased from 12.5 hours in 2014 to 22.6 hours, while urban areas now enjoy up to 23.4 hours of power supply, up from 22.1 hours in 2014. These improvements reflect significant progress in the reliability and reach of electricity services across the country.</p><p>Today, India is among the world’s top three energy consumers, and electricity demand continues to grow every year. The total electricity generation increased from 1,739.09 Billion Units (BU) in 2023–24 to 1,829.69 BU in 2024–25, a growth of 5.21%. For 2025–26, the generation target has been set at 2,000.4 BU.</p><p>This shift is being shaped by clear government initiatives, from scaling renewable energy and launching the National Green Hydrogen Mission, to modernising nuclear laws through the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Act, strengthening energy efficiency, reforming power distribution, and building digital energy infrastructure.</p><p>India’s evolving energy spectrum is not about abandoning the old overnight. It is about carefully building the new, step by step, so that the country can power growth, improve livelihoods, and move toward its long-term commitment of achieving Net Zero emissions by 2070.</p><p>Scaling Renewable Energy: From Expansion To Global Leader</p><p>India’s renewable energy expansion reflects a policy-driven transformation that combines scale, speed, manufacturing depth, and global engagement. Meanwhile, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)’s Renewable Energy Statistics 2025, India ranks fourth globally in total installed renewable energy capacity.</p><p>Solar energy, in particular, has seen rapid growth; installed solar capacity rose from 3 GW in 2014 to 140 GW in January 2026. This increase has helped push non-fossil fuel capacity beyond 50 percent of total installed electricity capacity.</p><p>Wind energy also plays a substantial role: India’s cumulative installed wind capacity reached about 54.65 GW by January 2026, contributing significantly to the renewable mix and strengthening grid diversification alongside solar. Together, solar and wind account for a dominant share of India’s clean energy capacity.</p><p>Government programmes have supported this scale-up across households, agriculture, infrastructure, and manufacturing:</p><p>PM Surya Ghar has enabled 23.9 lakh households to install rooftop solar systems, adding 7 GW of distributed clean energy capacity.</p><p>Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyaan (PM-KUSUM) promotes solarisation in agriculture, reducing diesel dependence and stabilising farm energy supply. The scheme aims to install 14 lakh standalone pumps (by 31.03.2026), promoting clean rural energy use.</p><p>55 solar parks across 13 states, have been approved, with a sanctioned capacity of nearly 40 GW, accelerating large-scale deployment.</p><p>The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme, with an outlay of ₹24,000 crore, is strengthening domestic solar manufacturing and reducing import dependence.</p><p>Renewable expansion now spans generation, infrastructure, manufacturing, and global engagement. The focus has shifted from simply adding capacity to building a competitive and self-reliant clean energy ecosystem.</p><p>Green Hydrogen: Building the Next Energy Frontier</p><p>Green hydrogen has emerged as a key pillar of India’s clean energy transition, particularly for sectors where reducing emissions is difficult, such as steel, fertilisers, refining, shipping, and heavy transport.</p><p>Green Hydrogen is Hydrogen produced using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, instead of fossil fuels. In this process, water is split into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis, using electricity from solar panels or wind turbines. According to standards notified by Govt of India, Hydrogen made this way is considered “green” if the total emissions from the process are very low, not more than 2 kg of CO₂ equivalent for every 1 kg of Hydrogen produced, taken as an average over last 12-month period. Green Hydrogen can also be produced by converting biomass (like agricultural waste) into hydrogen, as long as emissions remain below the same limit.</p><p>India has set a target of producing 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) of green hydrogen annually by 2030 under the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM), launched in 2023. The Mission is expected to:</p><p>Attract over ₹8 lakh crore in investments</p><p>Reduce fossil fuel imports by more than ₹1 lakh crore</p><p>Avoid nearly 50 MMT of greenhouse gas emissions annually by 2030</p><p>To support this scale-up, the government has approved an outlay of ₹19,744 crore till FY 2029–30, including ₹17,490 crore under the SIGHT programme, which provides incentives for domestic electrolyser manufacturing and hydrogen production.</p><p>Implementation is already underway:</p><p>India’s first port-based green hydrogen pilot has been commissioned.</p><p>Hydrogen mobility pilots are operational across 10 routes, involving buses and trucks.</p><p>The Green Hydrogen Certification Scheme (2025) ensures that hydrogen produced in India meets defined emission standards, strengthening credibility for domestic and export markets.</p><p>Green hydrogen connects renewable energy expansion with industrial decarbonisation. It is positioned not only as an environmental solution but also as a strategic tool for energy security, manufacturing growth, and global competitiveness. Nuclear, solar, and wind energy, green hydrogen, battery storage, and critical minerals to address both energy security and transition imperatives. Together, these measures position green hydrogen as the next frontier in India’s evolving energy spectrum.</p><p>Nuclear Energy: Legislative Modernisation and Baseload Expansion</p><p>Nuclear energy provides steady, round-the-clock electricity with very low greenhouse gas emissions. As renewable energy expands, nuclear power plays an important role in ensuring grid stability and a reliable baseload supply.</p><p>India’s present nuclear capacity stands at 8.78 GW. With new reactors under development, capacity is projected to rise to 22.38 GW by 2031–32. The Government has further announced a long-term Nuclear Energy Mission with a vision of achieving 100 GW by 2047, aligning nuclear expansion with India’s clean energy and energy security goals.</p><p>A major institutional reform supporting this expansion is the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Act, 2025. The Act consolidates and modernises India’s nuclear legal framework. It:</p><p>Enables limited private sector participation under regulatory oversight</p><p>Grants statutory recognition to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB)</p><p>Introduces a graded liability framework</p><p>Strengthens safety, security, and safeguards</p><p>Retains sovereign control over sensitive nuclear fuel-cycle activities</p><p>Complementing large reactors, the Nuclear Energy Mission allocates ₹20,000 crore for the development of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), targeting at least five indigenously designed SMRs by 2033. These advanced reactors are designed to be more flexible, scalable, and suitable for diverse energy needs.</p><p>Strengthening Energy Efficiency & Carbon Markets</p><p>Energy efficiency is not only about producing clean energy, but it is also about using energy wisely. It means accomplishing the same tasks while consuming less electricity, fuel, or heat. This lowers costs and improves system reliability, while conservation focuses on avoiding waste.</p><p>India has strengthened its efficiency framework through policy reform and market-based mechanisms over the years.</p><p>A major shift has been the transition from the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme to the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS). Under CCTS:</p><p>Emission-intensive industries are assigned greenhouse gas intensity targets.</p><p>Entities that perform better than their targets earn tradable carbon credits.</p><p>Credits can be bought and sold, creating a market incentive for efficiency improvements.</p><p>At the household level, energy efficiency programmes are being implemented to promote the adoption of efficient appliances and lighting. The UJALA programme has distributed 36.87 crore LED bulbs, resulting in:</p><p>47,883 million kWh of annual energy savings</p><p>3.88 million tonnes of CO₂ reduction per year</p><p>Do You Know? UJALA’s LED-bulb distribution model is being exported beyond India. The state of Melaka in Malaysia adopted a UJALA-type scheme under an agreement with Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL). Earlier, the government had launched UJALA-UK to promote efficient lighting.</p><p>Digital platforms such as the Urja Dakshata Information Tool (UDIT) further improve transparency, monitoring, and compliance across sectors.</p><p>Energy efficiency reduces demand pressure on the grid while complementing renewable expansion. It ensures that growth in electricity access does not automatically lead to proportionate growth in emissions.</p><p>Power Sector Reforms and Distribution Strengthening</p><p>Reliable electricity depends not only on how power is generated, but also on how efficiently it is transmitted, distributed, billed, and managed. Strengthening the distribution system has therefore been a central focus of reform.</p><p>Under Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), and Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA), about ₹1.85 lakh crore was invested to upgrade distribution infrastructure. As a result, 18,374 villages were electrified, and 2.86 crore households gained electricity connections, significantly expanding access across the country.</p><p>The next phase of reform has focused on improving the financial and operational health of DISCOMs. The Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS), launched in 2021 with an outlay of ₹3.03 lakh crore, has approved projects worth ₹2.8 lakh crore to modernise infrastructure and implement smart metering.</p><p>As part of this digital transformation, 5.62 crore smart electricity meters have been installed across the country under various schemes. These meters improve billing accuracy, reduce technical and commercial losses, and enable better demand management through near real-time data.</p><p>Legislative reform complements these structural improvements. The proposed draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2026, seeks to strengthen the financial viability of the sector, enhance the competitiveness of the Indian industry, promote optimal utilization of the distribution network, and improve regulatory accountability.</p><p>Draft National Electricity Policy, 2026, lays out strategies for achieving the vision of providing reliable 24x7 quality power through a financially viable and environmentally sustainable power sector, furthering energy security at an affordable price.</p><p>India Energy Stack (IES): From Energy Access to Energy Agency</p><p>IES is a Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) designed to enable trusted digital interactions across consumers, utilities, regulators, and distributed energy assets. Conceived to address fragmented data systems and costly integrations, IES will provide common digital rails based on open standards and consent-based data sharing, while ensuring that data remains with rightful owners.</p><p>The initiative standardises data exchange to help create an ecosystem that is , interoperable, competitive, and capable of converting participation into economic value .</p><p>IES aims to transform consumers into active energy participants by enabling:</p><p>Portable and simplified onboarding across utilities</p><p>Meaningful consumer choice through consent-based data sharing</p><p>Monetisation of rooftop solar, batteries, EV chargers, and flexible loads at scale</p><p>By embedding “policy as code” and enabling near real-time settlement, IES strengthens transparency, reduces disputes, and enhances grid coordination. By aligning open innovation with system efficiency and livelihood creation, IES strengthens the energy agency, giving consumers the ability to choose and earn from the energy transition at scale.</p><p>Global Leadership and Strategic Partnerships</p><p>As India strengthens its domestic energy transition, it is also shaping global conversations on clean energy, affordability, and sustainability. International partnerships complement national reforms and position India as an active contributor to global energy solutions.</p><p>India plays a leading role in multilateral platforms such as the G20 Energy Transitions Working Group, where it has advanced cooperation on clean fuels and energy security. During its G20 Presidency, India launched the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA), which now includes 25 countries and 12 international organisations, promoting affordable and low-carbon biofuels worldwide.</p><p>The country has further strengthened cooperation in energy efficiency by joining the International Energy Efficiency Hub (2024), aligning domestic initiatives with global best practices.</p><p>Under the UNFCCC framework, India has committed to achieving Net Zero by 2070, reducing the emissions intensity of GDP by 45% by 2030, reflecting its balanced approach to growth and climate responsibility.</p><p>Together, these engagements position India as a constructive voice of the Global South on affordable clean energy, equitable climate finance, and access to technology.</p><p>India’s global clean energy outreach is anchored in two major initiatives, the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and India Energy Week (IEW), both together advance solar cooperation and broader energy dialogue at the international level.</p><p>International Solar Alliance (ISA): Co-founded by India, ISA brings together over 125 member and signatory countries to mobilise solar finance, promote technology transfer, and expand affordable solar deployment, particularly across developing nations.</p><p>India Energy Week (IEW): Hosted by India, IEW serves as a global platform for governments, industry leaders, investors, and technology providers to engage on energy security, clean fuels, renewables, and transition pathways, strengthening India’s role as a convenor in the global energy landscape.</p><p>India’s energy journey is no longer defined by a single source; it’s now drawing strength from solar parks, rooftop panels, hydrogen pilots, modernised nuclear frameworks, smart meters, and digital platforms.</p><p>Milestones such as expanding renewable capacity, advancing the National Green Hydrogen Mission, strengthening DISCOMs, and building the India Energy Stack reflect a transition that is both structured and forward-looking. This transformation is not sudden. It is planned. It is layered. And it is supported by policy reform, infrastructure investment, technological innovation, and global cooperation.</p><p>As India moves toward its Net Zero 2070 commitment, the evolving spectrum of energy sources shows that growth and sustainability can move together. The power that supports homes, farms, factories, and data centres will come from a system designed to be resilient, inclusive, and prepared for future needs.</p><p>India is not just generating power. It is redesigning how power is produced, delivered, and shared for a future that is secure, sustainable, and self-reliant.</p><p>Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoPNG)</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2036867&reg=3&lang=2 https://mopng.gov.in/en/page/68 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1809204</p><p>Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE)</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2071486 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2183434 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2208694 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2144627 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2117501 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2200441 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2156173 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2110283 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2042069 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1763712 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2183866 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2176518 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1943779 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2041641 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2111106 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2004187 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1795071 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1961797</p><p>https://mnre.gov.in/en/physical-progress/ https://mnre.gov.in/en/year-wise-achievement https://mnre.gov.in/en/policies-and-regulations/schemes-and-guidelines/schemes/ https://mnre.gov.in/en/wind-policy-and-guidelines/ https://mnre.gov.in/en/national-green-hydrogen-mission https://pmkusum.mnre.gov.in/#/landing https://pmsuryaghar.gov.in/ https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3716e1b8c6cd17b771da77391355749f3/uploads/2025/11/202511061627678782.pdf</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2166110&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://mnre.gov.in/en/national-green-hydrogen-mission/</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2165811&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2039091&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2138051&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2023625&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2075049&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=2030686&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.indiaenergyweek.com/</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?id=155063 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?id=154717</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2215187&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)</p><p>https://ndmindia.mha.gov.in/ndmi/leadership-initiatives</p><p>Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEFCC)</p><p>https://missionlife-moefcc.nic.in/</p><p>https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2022-11/Mission_LiFE_Brochure.pdf https://niti.gov.in/key-initiatives/life</p><p>Parliament of India / Sansad</p><p>https://sansad.in/ls/legislation/bills https://sansad.in/getFile/annex/269/AU1111_Djrfhp.pdf?source=pqars https://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/185/AU491_lHmqAc.pdf?source=pqars https://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/186/AU1638_Yolfxg.pdf?source=pqals https://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/186/AU490_gwc1C9.pdf?source=pqals</p><p>https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1847812&reg=3&lang=2 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1837898&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>PIB Archived / Static Document</p><p>https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/specificdocs/documents/2022/nov/doc2022119122601.pdf</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?id=156593&NoteId=156593&ModuleId=3&reg=3&lang=2</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2199729&reg=3&lang=1</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressNoteDetails.aspx?NoteId=156480&ModuleId=3&reg=3&lang=2#:~:text=Recognising%20their%20importance%2C%20India%20observes,contributions%20towards%20efficient%20energy%20use.</p><p>https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2219208&reg=3&lang=1</p>",

These measures, he said, are encouraging entrepreneurship, supporting traditional artisans, and enabling street vendors and small entrepreneurs to gain dignity and economic stability.</p><p>Calling this “the best time to be in India,” Dr. Jitendra Singh urged young Indians, including those pursuing higher studies abroad, to remain connected with the nation’s growth story. He said that while global exposure is valuable, India today offers unprecedented opportunities in research, innovation,and enterprise.</p><p>Concluding his address, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that Viksit Bharat in 2047 will be shaped by the youth of today. The responsibility of the present generation, he said, is to build capacity, strengthen institutions and create an enabling ecosystem so that when India celebrates 100 years of independence, it stands as a fully developed, innovation-driven and globally respected nation.</p><p>Union Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh delivering Keynote address on the theme “Viksit Bharat 2047” during 5th P.

Persistent infection with high-risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types, particularly types 16 and 18 – has been established as the primary cause of cervical cancer.</p><p>The nationwide HPV vaccination campaign aims to prevent cervical cancer by protecting girls before potential exposure to HPV infection. The vaccine is safe, effective and provides long-lasting protection against HPV strains responsible for the majority of cervical cancer cases.</p><p>HPV vaccination has been validated and recommended by global and national expert bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO) and India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI).</p><p>Globally 160 out of 194 countries have introduced HPV vaccine under their National Immunization Programmes. 90 countries have adopted a single-dose schedule, including majority of Southeast Asian countries. 80 countries are using Gardasil-4 vaccine in their National Immunization Programme. Out of these, 61 countries are implementing a single-dose schedule of Gardasil-4.</p><p>HPV vaccines are 93–100% effective in preventing cervical cancer caused by vaccine-covered HPV types. Evidence also shows a strong herd effect – high vaccination coverage reduces circulation of HPV strains, thereby providing indirect protection even to unvaccinated individuals.</p><p>India’s national programme uses Gardasil-4 (Quadrivalent: HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18) in a single-dose schedule, aligned with global scientific evidence and WHO recommendations.</p><p>Target Population and Coverage:</p><p>The campaign will cover girls aged 14 years (those who have completed 14 years but have not yet completed 15 years). As per Registrar General of India (RGI) 2021 estimates, the annual cohort of 14-year-old girls is approximately 1.2 crore, who are expected to benefit from this initiative each year.</p><p>Operational Plan of the HPV Vaccination Campaign:</p><p>The introduction of HPV vaccination in India has been meticulously planned with detailed attention to safety, logistics and monitoring.</p><p>Vaccination Duration: 3 months (90 days) in campaign mode.</p><p>After completion of the campaign phase, HPV vaccine will be available on routine immunization session days.</p><p>Session Sites: Only Government Health Facilities like Ayushman Arogya Mandir (AAM) – Primary Health Centres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs), Sub-District Hospitals (SDHs), District Hospitals (DHs), Government Medical Colleges and Hospitals (GMCHs)</p><p>Dose & Administration: Single dose (0.5 ml) Intramuscular (IM) injection in the left upper arm</p><p>Vaccination is voluntary, free of cost and will be administered only after parental/guardian consent.</p><p>Beneficiaries may pre-register and schedule appointments on the U-WIN digital platform, or opt for walk-in vaccination at designated government health facilities. Parental/guardian consent is mandatory and will be recorded digitally on U-WIN. In areas without internet connectivity, consent may be obtained in hard copy as per prescribed format.</p><p>The U-WIN platform will be used for session planning, registration, recording and reporting, while the e-VIN portal will manage vaccine stocks and logistics.</p><p>Extensive preparatory activities, including nationwide capacity-building exercises covering all technical and operational aspects, have been undertaken. Detailed guidelines have been shared with all States and Union Territories to ensure seamless implementation.</p><p>The programme follows strict medical guidelines. Vaccination will be deferred or avoided in the following cases:</p><p>Girls with moderate or severe illness until recovery</p><p>Girls with a history of severe allergic reaction to previous vaccination</p><p>Girls known to be allergic to yeast</p><p>Girls outside the target age group</p><p>For girls who have already received any HPV vaccine (Gardasil, Gardasil-9, Cervarix, or Cervavac), their vaccination status will be updated on the U-WIN portal.</p><p>All vaccination sessions are conducted under supervision of trained Medical Officers, with functional Cold Chain Points (CCPs) and linkage to 24×7 government health facilities for management of any rare Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI).</p><p>Following the Prime Minister’s national launch, HPV vaccination campaign launches were held across all States and Union Territories through local events.</p><p>The nationwide HPV vaccination campaign represents a transformative step in India’s preventive healthcare strategy and reflects delivery-oriented governance rooted in scientific evidence and implementation readiness.</p><p>The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare urges parents and guardians to ensure that their 14-year-old daughters receive the HPV vaccine during the campaign period. HPV vaccination is a powerful preventive intervention that can save lives and secure a healthier, cancer-free future for India’s daughters.</p><p>Dr. Sanjay Roy/Anand Chaturvedi</p><p>HFW/PM Launch of HPV Vaccination/28th February 2026/1</p><p>Read this release in: Kannada , Marathi , Tamil</p>",

The Prime Minister paid homage to the cultural and heroic legacy of the region, including the Tejaji Dham of Sursura and the bravery of Major Dalpat Singh, whose role in liberating Haifa is still honored in Israel.” The Prime Minister expressed satisfaction that the \"double-engine government\" in Rajasthan has completed two years of rapid progress. “The government is fulfilling the promises of development with which it came to serve the people. And today is a day to further accelerate this campaign of development.” emphasised Shri Modi.

Furthermore, the Prime Minister launched the nationwide HPV vaccination campaign from Ajmer, describing it as a pivotal step toward empowering India’s ‘Nari Shakti’ (women power) and ensuring the health of mothers and daughters. “We all know that when a mother falls ill in the family, the house feels scattered. If the mother is healthy, the family remains capable of facing every crisis. With this sentiment the government has run many schemes to provide support to women.” Shri Modi highlighted.</p><p>The Prime Minister detailed the government’s sensitive approach to women’s health and dignity, citing the successful implementation of \"mission mode\" solutions for toilets, sanitary pads, and the Ujjwala Gas Scheme. He also mentioned the safe motherhood scheme that deposits ₹5,000 into the accounts of sisters to ensure nutritious food during pregnancy, moving away from a culture of neglect to one of sensitivity.</p><p>Focusing on infrastructure, the Prime Minister stated that modern connectivity through roads, rail, and air is changing the destiny of Rajasthan. He highlighted how improved travel facilitates tourism in places like Ajmer-Pushkar, directly supporting local businesses, artisans, and taxi drivers. “The infrastructure being built around the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor is turning Rajasthan into a \"land of opportunities\" for global investment, \" Shri Modi said. Reflecting on India's rising global stature, Shri Modi spoke about the world's largest AI Summit held in Delhi, recently and his visit to Israel, where India’s progress and valor were praised. Shri Modi said, “Prime ministers and presidents of many countries of the world came to it; the heads of big companies came; everyone praised India with an open mind”. Highlighting the success of India' s Armed forces In the last 11 years, Shri Modi said, “ the Indian Army has dealt a heavy blow to terrorists and the enemies of the country on every front.

    "summaryText": "<p>English rendering of PM’s address during launch of development works, nationwide campaign for HPV vaccination from Ajmer</p><p>On this sacred land of Tirthraj Pushkar and Mother Savitri, today I have had the opportunity to come among you, to receive your blessings. From this stage, I bow to the Tejaji Dham of Surasura and to the land of Prithviraj, Ajmer.</p><p>Brave Tejaji Maharaj ki Jai</p><p>Varun Avatar Lord Jhulelal Ji ki Jai</p><p>On the dais are the Hon’ble Governor of Rajasthan, Shri Haribhau Bagde Ji; the popular Chief Minister of the State, Shri Bhajanlal Sharma Ji; former Chief Minister, sister Vasundhara Ji; my colleague in the Union Council of Ministers, Shri Bhagirath Choudhary Ji; Deputy Chief Ministers Shri Premchand Bairwa Ji and Smt. Diya Kumari Ji; my colleagues in Parliament; the State President of the BJP, Shri Madan Rathore Ji; other esteemed Ministers; distinguished dignitaries; and my beloved brothers and sisters of Rajasthan. I am deeply grateful to the revered saints, who have graced this occasion in such large numbers to bless us with their presence.</p><p>Ajmer is the land of faith and valor. Here there are sacred pilgrimages, and also the footprints of revolutionaries. Only yesterday I returned to India after completing my visit to Israel. The people of Israel still proudly remember the valor of Rajasthan’s son, Major Dalpat Singh. I too had the privilege in Israel’s Parliament to pay homage to Major Dalpat Singh Ji’s bravery. I had the honor of recounting the glory of Rajasthan’s brave warriors who played a role in liberating the city of Haifa in Israel.</p><p>Just some time ago, the BJP’s double-engine government in Rajasthan completed two years. I am satisfied that today Rajasthan is advancing on a new path of development. The promises of progress with which the BJP government came to serve you are being fulfilled rapidly. And today is a day to accelerate this campaign of development. A short while ago, projects worth nearly 17 thousand crore rupees connected to Rajasthan’s development were inaugurated and dedicated. In every sector-roads, electricity, water, health, education-new strength is being added. All these projects will enhance the convenience of the people of Rajasthan and will also create employment opportunities for the youth of Rajasthan.</p><p>The BJP’s double-engine government is continuously empowering the youth. Two years ago, Rajasthan was in the news only for corruption in recruitments and paper leaks. Now, paper leaks have been curbed, strict action is being taken against the guilty. Today, from this very stage, appointment letters have been handed over to more than 21 thousand youth of Rajasthan. This is a huge transformation. For this change, for the new jobs, for all the works of development, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all of you people of Rajasthan.</p><p>Today, from this land of brave women, I have had the opportunity to launch an important campaign for the daughters of the country. From here in Ajmer, the HPV vaccination campaign has been started. This campaign is a significant step in the direction of empowering the women power of the nation.</p><p>We all know that when a mother falls ill, the household feels shattered. But if the mother is healthy, the family can face any crisis with strength. With this sentiment, the BJP government has launched numerous schemes to empower women.</p><p>We have witnessed the time before 2014, when the absence of toilets caused immense suffering and humiliation for our sisters and daughters. Girls would drop out of school because there were no separate toilet facilities. Poor daughters could not afford sanitary pads. For those who were in power earlier, these were trivial matters, not even worth discussing. But for us, these were sensitive issues that harmed the health and dignity of our sisters and daughters. That is why we resolved them in mission mode.</p><p>During pregnancy, malnutrition posed a grave threat to mothers’ lives. We introduced schemes for safe motherhood, ensuring mothers received nutritious food, with ₹5,000 deposited directly into their accounts. Mothers used to cough in smoke but never complained. We said this cannot continue. That is why we launched the Ujjwala Gas Scheme. All this became possible because the BJP government works not with a sense of power, but with sensitivity.</p><p>A quarter of the 21st century has already passed. This is a crucial time for Rajasthan’s development. The BJP’s double-engine government is carrying forward both Rajasthan’s heritage and progress together. We all know that good roads, railways, and air connectivity don’t just make travel easier-they change the destiny of entire regions. When roads reach every village, farmers can sell their crops at fair prices. Traders can easily send their goods outside. And who doesn’t know the tourism strength of Ajmer-Pushkar? Improved connectivity has the greatest impact on tourism. When travel becomes easier, more people come to visit.</p><p>When tourists arrive, naturally hotels thrive, roadside eateries do well, kachoris and dal baati sell more, Rajasthan’s artisans find buyers for their crafts, taxis run, and guides get work. In other words, one tourist becomes the livelihood for many families. With this vision, our government is strongly focusing on modern connectivity in Rajasthan.</p><p>As connectivity expands in Rajasthan, opportunities for investment are also steadily increasing. Around the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, a world-class infrastructure is being developed for industries. In other words, to make Rajasthan a land of opportunities, the double-engine government is working tirelessly in multiple ways.</p><p>Mothers of Rajasthan instill the values of patriotism in their children while raising them. This land of Rajasthan knows what respect for the nation means, and that is why today, on this soil of Rajasthan, I have come to share one more thought with you.</p><p>Recently, in Delhi, the world’s largest AI conference was held. Prime Ministers, Presidents, and Ministers from many countries attended the event. Leaders of the world’s biggest companies also gathered under one roof. Everyone openly praised India. I want to ask my brothers and sisters of Rajasthan-when so many people from around the world praise India, don’t you feel proud? Don’t you feel honored? Doesn’t your head rise high? Doesn’t your chest swell with pride?</p><p>You felt proud, but you also saw what the Congress, sunk in despair and exhaustion from continuous defeats, did. In front of guests from all over the world, Congress tried to defame the nation. They staged a whole drama to disgrace the country before foreign visitors.</p><p>Congress is losing across the nation, and in anger, they are taking revenge by tarnishing India’s image. Once Congress was the INC-the Indian National Congress. But today, it is no longer INC. Instead of INC, it has become MMC. MMC means Muslim League Maoist Congress.</p><p>My brave people of Rajasthan,</p><p>History bears witness that the Muslim League hated India, and that is why it partitioned the country. Today Congress is doing the same. Maoists too hate India’s prosperity, our Constitution, and our successful democracy. They attack from ambush. Congress also sneaks in anywhere to defame the nation. The country will never forgive such misdeeds of Congress.</p><p>Defaming the nation and weakening our armed forces has been Congress’s old habit. Remember, this is the same Congress that left our soldiers longing even for weapons and uniforms. This is the same Congress that deprived military families of One Rank One Pension for years. This is the same Congress under whose rule massive scams took place in defense deals with foreign countries.</p><p>In the past 11 years, India’s army has struck hard against terrorists and enemies on every front. Our army has been victorious in every mission, every battle. From surgical strikes to Operation Sindoor, they proved their valor. Yet Congress leaders chose to amplify the lies of our enemies. Whatever is good for the nation, whatever benefits the people, Congress opposes it all. That is why today the country is teaching Congress a lesson.</p><p>In Rajasthan, you have experienced Congress’s misrule closely. During its tenure here, Congress was entangled only in corruption and internal conflicts. Congress has always betrayed our farmers. Remember how Congress kept irrigation projects hanging for decades, causing immense loss to Rajasthan’s farmers. The ERCP project was trapped only in files and announcements by Congress governments. As soon as our government came, we worked to bring this scheme out of files and onto the ground.</p><p>The campaign to link rivers that our government has started will greatly benefit Rajasthan. Be it the revised Parvati-Kalisindh-Chambal link project or the Yamuna-Rajasthan link project, the double-engine government is committed to delivering the benefits of such irrigation projects to farmers. Even today, numerous water projects have begun for Jhalawar, Baran, Kota, and Bundi districts. Our effort is also to raise the groundwater level in Rajasthan.</p><p>The BJP government, understanding Rajasthan’s potential, is designing and implementing schemes. I am happy that Rajasthan has now become a land that earns prosperity from the power of the sun. We all know that Rajasthan has no shortage of sunlight. Now this sunlight is becoming a source of savings and income for ordinary households. And in this, the Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Free Electricity Scheme plays a major role. This scheme has the power to change Rajasthan’s destiny. Under this scheme, the BJP government provides ₹78,000 in assistance for installing solar panels on rooftops. The government transfers the money directly into your bank account. Look at all the budgets and schemes since independence-you will not find a scheme that benefits the middle class so much. Today, families are receiving ₹78,000 directly from the government to install solar panels. The middle class is benefiting the most. This creates a small power plant at home. During the day, electricity is generated from sunlight, which is used in the household, and the surplus electricity goes to the grid. The household that generates electricity also gains from it.</p><p>Today, more than 125,000 families in Rajasthan have joined this scheme. And because of this scheme, many households are seeing their electricity bills drop to nearly zero. That means expenses have reduced, and savings have increased.</p><p>We are continuously working on the mantra of “Developed Rajasthan for a Developed India.” The projects that have begun today will further strengthen the foundation of a developed Rajasthan. When Rajasthan develops, every family here will live a prosperous life. Once again, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to you all for these development projects.
